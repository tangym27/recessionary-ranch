        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
          Our farming game was inspired by calming, casual games with low-stakes
          farming and cooking mechanics, such as Stardew Valley, Smurfs'
          Village, and Cats & Soup. It is a much more simplified prototype of
          these games that focuses on using fundamental OOP principles for
          player movement and collision, planting/growing/harvesting
          ingredients, and cooking/collecting dishes based on fixed recipes.
        </p>

        <h2>Game Concept</h2>
        <p>
          A recession is about to begin, and your plans to find a new job have
          been soiled. You're about to lose hope when, suddenly, you stumble
          upon the perfect plot of land for starting your own farm, complete
          with a bag of seeds, soil ready for cultivation, a watering can, a
          small pond, and a giant flying cow. There's even a kitchen with a
          recipe book that uses the crops you can grow! Make as much money as
          you can to prepare for the recession by growing and harvesting crops,
          then use them to cook dishes to sell. Unlock achievements along the
          way based on what you cook and how much you earn!
        </p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
          Please have your browser window set to at least 1000 pixels wide for
          the best experience!
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the WASD keys on your keyboard to move. (W = up, A = left, S =
          down, D = right)!
        </p>
        <p>
          The status window to the right of the game screen can be used to track
          your total profit, what seed you're currently planting, whether your
          watering can is empty or full, and your ingredient inventory (how many
          of each ingredient you currently have).
        </p>

          <div>
            <h3>Planting, Growing, Harvesting</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Press P to toggle the pop-up window that shows you what seeds
                you can plant. Click the image of the ingredient you want to
                plant.
              </li>
              <li>
                Walk up to a square of soil and press SPACE to plant a seed.
                Wait while the plant goes through 4 stages of growth - when it's
                fully matured and looks as it appears in the inventory or seed
                window, press SPACE in front of it to harvest it.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can speed up the growth of your crops by watering them. Walk
                up to the pond and press SPACE to fill your watering can. Walk
                up to a plant and press SPACE to water it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Plants can be watered as many times as you want until they're
                fully grown. However, your watering can is very small - you can
                only water one plant before it's empty again!
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Udderly Amoosing Cow Game</h3>
            <p>You can only obtain milk through this minigame!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Walk up to the white doors at the left of the game screen and
                press SPACE to begin the minigame. The Flying Cow will
                immediately begin to produce milk and dung!
              </li>
              <li>Use the A and D keys to move your bucket left and right.</li>
              <li>
                Collect milk bottles while avoiding the cow dung. The game ends
                when you collect a maximum of 10 bottles of milk or collect
                dung.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Cooking and Selling</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Walk up to a stove in the kitchen (at the top left of the game
                screen) and press SPACE to open the recipe book. Click the image
                of the recipe you want to cook.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have enough ingredients, the stove will turn brown to
                indicate it is being used. The dish will appear on the table
                behind the stove being used and slowly grow larger as it is
                being prepared.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the dish stops growing larger, it's ready to sell! Walk up
                to the table with the completed dish and press SPACE to sell it
                for its fixed cost (listed in the recipe book). Your total
                profit will be updated in the status window, and the stove will
                return to its normal color.
              </li>
              <li>
                Achievements you can unlock include surpassing $10, $100, and
                $200 in profit as well as cooking each dish in the recipe book
                at least once.

If a function calls drawTile, it is already offset.
There are two worlds - background world and plant world. If you are expanding, make sure to expand both.
If working with screenX and screenY, if those values come from the player, make sure to subtract the offsets of them. If they are coming from anything else, it's all kosher yay!
